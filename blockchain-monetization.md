#### Monetization

Monetization is key. Incentivization is what rules the internet and any publication platform should be centered around ‘how do we turn content into $.’

I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again that we need to consider tokenization and blockchain in order to put the ability to upvote/downvote content (self regulate and moderate) while also allowing shareholders and prolific content producers to have the most influence on the monetary rewards for contributing authors. While Steem appears to be failing because of a misbalance in currencies producing bidbots and scammy 115% returns on promotion budgets, there are alternative sidechains to consider that did away with the SBD concept and pay everything out as VESTed income, so that people are - in turn - vested into the success of the platform. Check smoke.io 1 and whaleshares.io 1.



Hey @jare, I believe that effectively mapping contributions into currency is the highest ceiling future of Hackernoon. But we have to walk before we run. Have to see the user experience first and learn from how people use the site. There’s a chance we never make it there.

But thinking farther into the future – what actions do you think should create currency? 1 day reading time created? Posting a story? Sharing a story? How do you like whaleshares.io in terms of how it rewards sharing? what works and what doesn’t?





I truly believe in DPoS as a technology - although with a few tweaks it could serve far better than it does on steemit.com.

When someone shares or upvotes a story, if it then becomes popular and earns a ton of rewards through the social algorithm % of inflation, that person who shared it to get it popular in the first place earns a % of that social % as a curator - as do all the other curators, weighted by when they expressed interest. This is important for a few reasons. .first, as your most prolific writers along with the team and the stakeholders would be the biggest currency holders, they can do a lot of good by spending time (or automation ways to) upvote posts they like, and get exposure to users or groups of users they think deserve it - you only get a certain number of upvotes/downvotes per day, which you can increase or decrease by increasing or decreasing the ‘strength’ of your vote (out of 100%). Second - these large token holders would also be paramount in fighting spam and self-regulating the environment. If there are people drawn to the site with the gleam in their eye of earning crypto by regurgitating content or plagiarizing, these highly vested people can ‘downvote’ said spammy posts and undo any earnings they may have accumulated - to the point that their post gets a negative up/downvote ratio and can be taken off of web + mobile + whatever UI interfaces to the chain. In short, you gain currency by sharing, creating, or upvoting content… . proportional to your VESTed interest in the platform.

Moreover, there can be other % uses for the inflation of the currency that can do a lot of good - one of the integral parts of DPoS is the ‘delegated’ part where there are many nodes hosted by many people, and they can acquire votes from users that are weighted based on how vested they are into the system as a whole. Some of these people (usually the top 21) will earn a % of the inflation pie just for helping produce blocks - but how they accumulate votes is the important part. They must continually deliver value and hold the network’s priorities at heart in order to outperform those other contenders - which is good for the network.

Lastly, there can be a ‘team’ or ‘reserve’ % of inflation that can be used to continually fundraise based on the current value of the coin. While everyone is earning via social algos or by being a witness, the team can have a source of continual income with which to spend on the project or improving various aspects to it.

I didn’t initially see this comment before your last comment. You bring up a lot of good points here. For a DPoS system to work well then we need incentives to be aligned. If the system is easy to exploit and incentives aren’t aligned then bad things happen.

@David @Dane I know that HN in the past has said one of the advantages to HN 2.0 will be the ability to publish without the hassle of ads… and a DPoS-driven network is one way to ensure that HN will never have to sustain itself by running ads. If the team creates wealth through inflation and the community drives the value of that currency upwards (when really the token came from almost nowhere and represents no legal obligation) it’s basically free money… for everyone :slight_smile: - while empowering those with faith and trust in the new platform to exert more influence by buying more and VESTing more.

It opens a whole lot of other doors, too. How do we add ‘real value’ to that coin? What sorts of services or products can we sell as a group or as the team that aligns the value of the coin to something? Can we create a distributed network of writers that are vouched by community consensus via a new kind of Blockchain reputation system that doesn’t yet exist in Blockchain content networks (aside from their exponential ‘rating’ applied to accounts which can be fabricated if you buy enough attention for your posts), and then pitch this new marketplace of content creators at brands and agencies for exposure and so everyone can win - while having them pay in the currency, which drives value? Swag stores? Can we set it up so that content creators on the network can hustle out communications to their subscriber list to these brands and agencies? What sort of services can we come up with that are ‘out of the box’ and apply to the hacker community?

If/when we launch a token, I think we owe it to the community to treat the currency more seriously than a source of “free money”. Sure, the upside of a token is very high…but the downside is also very low.

If our token becomes worthless then we’ll lose a lot of trust in the community.

As the value of the token goes up, so will the volume of low quality content from people purely interested in grabbing a few cheap coins.

I’m usually all for taking risks and exploring new concepts with the product. But when it comes to creating a new currency, I believe we need to take a more cautious approach.

I agree wholeheartedly. I think a good step in the right direction would be to move rewards from liquid to VESTed amounts, which means that those who are looking for a ‘quick buck’ will be less likely to spam up the ecosystem.

I really shouldn’t have said ‘free money,’ and you’re right that it’d have a huge impact on the project and the value of the coin could potentially devour what we’re trying to achieve - ‘Sure, the upside of a token is very high…but the downside is also very low.’ this is absolutely true!

I agree with this in principle but I do think the challenge of “getting it right” isn’t trivial. I hate to point to a platform that “got it wrong” as an example to suggest the idea doesn’t work and avoid taking up the challenge. If you look at a lot of historical innovations, you often see people boldly take on challenges that had previously failed.

But there is a lot to be learned from ecosystems that didn’t quite reach the finish line. I think back to Digg as an example. Sure there wasn’t an actual currency directly earned from posting and voting. But they did end up with a sort of DPoS system where a very small percentage of the users had the majority of the power. At one point, it was virtually impossible to get to the homepage without a vote from a top contributor. Eventually top contributors started exploiting their power to extract value from the ecosystem. I believe that was eventually one of the reasons a more democratic Reddit survived while Digg died…even though their product was arguably inferior at the time.

This is all to say that I believe in the idea but I think it’s important to get the balance right. And if stakeholder’s start abusing their stake then it’s important to have enough transparency within the ecosystem that the community can adapt and redistribute stake accordingly.
