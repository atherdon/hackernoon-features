> an import story from other websites function (requested by one of our writers!)

Importing stories is tricky, but I’d love to support Google Drive integration at some point, and Word documents (although we might have to play fast and loose there – that file format is capital-I-Insane from what I’ve read). I want the editor to be a killer feature, but at the same time, I understand writers have their preferred tools. Personally, I love writing in Word.

#### stats

Stats like Medium has - but maybe with more statistic. Or figure out how make people read more


Thanks Austin,
Regarding additional stats, I was thinking of readers’ locations and where readers who did not read the entire post stopped reading for example.


As for stats, there’s definitely a lot more we can do than we provide today. What sort of stats would you like to see @arthur.tkachenko @patriciadehemricourt? Any and all ideas are appreciated!



#### Small F

1) If you will have Voice-To-Text ability -> it will be awesome. BEcause I'm lazy to type it

2) What do you think about Po.et thing? Can it be helpful for HN?

3) I think HN need to use more help and more tools. Like code can be shared between people, editorial work too. I think form + email should be updated with form+ slack+bots, etc…

4) New feature: I want to have an advanced bookmarks. Where i can have tags or something. Because my bookmarks at Medium looks bad
