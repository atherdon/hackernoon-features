Importing stories is tricky, but I’d love to support Google Drive integration at some point, and Word documents (although we might have to play fast and loose there – that file format is capital-I-Insane from what I’ve read). I want the editor to be a killer feature, but at the same time, I understand writers have their preferred tools. Personally, I love writing in Word.

#### stats

Stats like Medium has - but maybe with more statistic. Or figure out how make people read more


Thanks Austin,
Regarding additional stats, I was thinking of readers’ locations and where readers who did not read the entire post stopped reading for example.


As for stats, there’s definitely a lot more we can do than we provide today. What sort of stats would you like to see @arthur.tkachenko @patriciadehemricourt? Any and all ideas are appreciated!



#### Small F

1) If you will have Voice-To-Text ability -> it will be awesome. BEcause I'm lazy to type it

2) What do you think about Po.et thing? Can it be helpful for HN?

3) I think HN need to use more help and more tools. Like code can be shared between people, editorial work too. I think form + email should be updated with form+ slack+bots, etc…

4) New feature: I want to have an advanced bookmarks. Where i can have tags or something. Because my bookmarks at Medium looks bad

#### Events

well done search and filterable with alerts global calendar of conferences and events with confirmed attendees. this is pretty useful for me.

Yes! We’re thinking of building something like a marketplace on events.hackernoon.com where conferences/events could give contributors free press entry and contributors can sign up to go and write a story. Recently one of our contributors David Choi went to Davos and covered the Blockchain Economic Forum on behalf of Hacker Noon. We get media partnership invites from all sorts of tech conferences on a daily basis. If we do it right, we can get to a point where every single tech event would have a HN rep/attendee, and we will be able to build out a filter-able calendar.

#### Newsletter digest

Some sort of newsletter digest. Check TechMemo or Sip from ProductHunt.

+1 upvote on the digest

Data viz of the day or week


#### Editorial calendar

Editorial calendar with ability to see the queue of pending articles. Like where is my post in a line?

Yep #1 is a MUST have…
I submitted an article before the weekend and what’s usually a 24hr turn around is now 3 days in - so would be great to have some visibility in that backlog.


All great ideas! I’ll talk over all of these with @Dane when he gets back, but I wanted to address a few of these ideas in particular below:
We definitely want to give you more feedback on the editorial process, and we will have a “Recent Activity” feed in 2.0 that will tell you when an editor has opened, edited, or approved your story. Of course, that doesn’t tell you when an editor will actually open it – it will be difficult, but I think it’s doable to give you an estimate. It won’t be there from day 1, but I’ll talk to Dane about it as soon as he gets back.
