ut the process will be a lot simpler in 2.0.
1) You work on a draft similar to the current process.
2) Once you are ready to publish click a 'submit for review' button.
3) You'll get email notifications telling you whenever the status of your draft changes. (In review, changes requested, rejected, scheduled, published...)
4) If an editor makes changes to your draft you'll see what changed. If you accept all the changes, the draft can be immediately scheduled. Otherwise, you'd resubmit the draft.
5) Then the draft gets published and we give you access to stats and the ability to make changes as needed.
Anything else you'd like to see in the submission process? We're thinking about other ways to communicate with the editor but that will likely be email for MVP.
