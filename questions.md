Did this feature clear for current developers?

**Feature that didnt moved**


Sometimes I'm asking for a help of proof-reading, but not of all my friends are interested to doing it. How I did it with my friend:
He publish an article, show it to me, I read it with a fresh eye and usually tell him a places that confusing me.
Like this:
"bla1 bla2 bla3 bla4 bla5"
> Add more details or add Blah blah after bla1 bla2

I'm a terrible writer and i know it.
