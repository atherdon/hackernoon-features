Editorial calendar with ability to see the queue of pending articles. Like where is my post in a line?
Some sort of newsletter digest. Check TechMemo or Sip from ProductHunt.
You can collaborate with ProductHunt Makers. They have a separated place, related to goal on blogging. And I think Its a dream for a lot of people to being published on HN.
Stats like Medium has - but maybe with more statistic. Or figure out how make people read more
Some sort of an API and maybe React component, that will help to fetch all author articles and display a “List of Cards” with links to articles. (I find it’s hard to grab all my stuff from Medium and place links at my Gatsby/Docusaurus website)

I am with arthur.tkachenko , especially on points 1 and 4 above
Maybe also a wy to leverage the community’s social media network to expand articles reach. Something along the lines of triberr.com 2
An option to edit the default text displayed when sharing on social media

All great ideas! I’ll talk over all of these with @Dane when he gets back, but I wanted to address a few of these ideas in particular below:
We definitely want to give you more feedback on the editorial process, and we will have a “Recent Activity” feed in 2.0 that will tell you when an editor has opened, edited, or approved your story. Of course, that doesn’t tell you when an editor will actually open it – it will be difficult, but I think it’s doable to give you an estimate. It won’t be there from day 1, but I’ll talk to Dane about it as soon as he gets back.
As for stats, there’s definitely a lot more we can do than we provide today. What sort of stats would you like to see @arthur.tkachenko @patriciadehemricourt? Any and all ideas are appreciated!
We’ve actually been talking about an API, and that’s a perfect use case, Arthur! It won’t be there from day 1, but an API is a part of our long-term strategy. Giving authors access to their posts alone would be incredibly valuable – thanks for that idea!
We’ve been talking about newsletters as well. @arthur.tkachenko what sort of content would you like to see in the newsletter? Top posts? Or more of a hand-curated collection of interesting stories? Just curious what you have in mind here.
@patriciadehemricourt I’ll personally make sure point #3 is addressed in 2.0.  As for point #2, triberr looks interesting, and we’re always looking for ways to amplify the publish button. I’ll bring this up with the team, for sure.
Sorry for the wall of text! If you have any other ideas, suggestions, criticism, or anything, please share!

New feature: I want to have an advanced bookmarks. Where i can have tags or something. Because my bookmarks at Medium looks bad

well done search and filterable with alerts global calendar of conferences and events with confirmed attendees. this is pretty useful for me.

Thanks Austin,
Regarding additional stats, I was thinking of readers’ locations and where readers who did not read the entire post stopped reading for example.

Yep #1 is a MUST have…
I submitted an article before the weekend and what’s usually a 24hr turn around is now 3 days in - so would be great to have some visibility in that backlog.

Data viz of the day or week

I think HN need to use more help and more tools. Like code can be shared between people, editorial work too. I think form + email should be updated with form+ slack+bots, etc…

I think peer-review possibility between authors in Hackernoon will be a good way to promote the community-based tech blog, to reduce the workload of the Hackernoon internal team and prepare a base step to use the blockchain concept in Hackernoon. At first, we can point some accredited authors and let them co-review the post. A post can be published after, for example, 3 approves. This is rather a conceptual and abstract idea and I hope I can answer some questions if you have.

+1 upvote on the digest

DaneTeam jarvisluong: I think peer-review possibility between authors in Hackernoon will be a good way to promote the community-based tech blog I really like this idea but I’m not sure I’d want to make publishing depend on getting 3 peer reviews. One of the bigger benefits of HN is the ability to get an opinion piece out there without jumping through a ton of hoops. Do you think it would be viable to make peer reviews a post-publishing option? So say you put out a piece and other writers would have the option to do a peer review. If the piece hits some threshold of say 3-5 reviews then it gets added to a Peer Reviewed section of the homepage. This might not be a good approach but I’m trying to find a way to maintain a simple editorial process while getting the benefit from peer reviews.

I like this a lot too. Makes a lot of sense for deeper analysis pieces. I also am excited about possibility of flow where requests for edits on smaller pieces become a co-authored longer form piece.

Let’s integrate Github with HN, so new article will be at *.md format and queued articles will have ability to receive comments/edits i agree, it’s so nerd-like

well done search and filterable with alerts global calendar of conferences and events with confirmed attendees. this is pretty useful for me.Yes! We’re thinking of building something like a marketplace on events.hackernoon.com where conferences/events could give contributors free press entry and contributors can sign up to go and write a story. Recently one of our contributors David Choi went to Davos and covered the Blockchain Economic Forum on behalf of Hacker Noon. We get media partnership invites from all sorts of tech conferences on a daily basis. If we do it right, we can get to a point where every single tech event would have a HN rep/attendee, and we will be able to build out a filter-able calendar.

Awesome idea!We’ve talked about doing this and I think there are a lot of interesting Github integration options. In addition to pulling content from Github, I’d also love to push content to repos. This could be great for teams that want to cobble together a “best practices” doc in their repo composed of snippets from a variety of Hacker Noon and other sources.

it will save time, and not only developers use Github, i know that scientists(astrophysicists) use it as collaboration tool. And markdown is an easy format and have a new wave of attention recently.
next point - i think it’ll give cool marketing value for HN
next point - roles, kanban, labels

an import story from other websites function (requested by one of our writers!)

Importing stories is tricky, but I’d love to support Google Drive integration at some point, and Word documents (although we might have to play fast and loose there – that file format is capital-I-Insane from what I’ve read). I want the editor to be a killer feature, but at the same time, I understand writers have their preferred tools. Personally, I love writing in Word.

I’m definitely interested in Github integration as well, not only for markdown support, but for some wild future collaborative writing project that only exists in my head at the moment (it sounds like @dane is on the same wavelength, though).  It would be super interesting to see the editing process play out on Github (PRs == suggested changes?). There’s just so much potential there, and so much of our audience is already on Github, it just seems like an overall win for us.

I forgot about peer reviews! That’s one of the most interesting parts! Peer reviews, allowing 3-4 fellow writers to approve a post, is super interesting to me, particularly given my past crowdsourcing experience (and yours, @dane ). I imagine some writers will be “better” at judging which posts are “high-quality” – I’m using scare quotes because these are highly subjective, nebulous terms. Maybe we need some relative scale of quality. I’m starting to spitball here, just thinking aloud, but I’ll definitely put some more thought into this. I think it’ll be necessary in some form, at some point, to scale the editorial process (but I could be wrong).

Would love to see story title/headline creator. This might be something similar to https://coschedule.com/headline-analyzer 1 but very specific to hackernoon.
Based on the topic and some data science magic, it would be a killer feature to see hackernoon help writers craft an inviting title/headline

The e-mail follow feature that @David mentioned sounds interesting. Would it allow integrations with things like MailChimp? That would certainly be a useful feature.

This chat is looks overwhelming right now - still when we don’t have a lot of people. I propose to create a trello board with features, or github page with upvote/downvote or at least Google Spreedsheat with ability to add +1.And I think it’s time to split goals in 2 sections “Going to Mars”, “Sub-orbital flights”. Because I think with big amount of tools, that we have right now on market - we can easily help to editors solve a real time problem.Like spend 1 day and launch something that will be useful right now. But for sure, we need big goals too.Upd. there is one startup, that have upvote/downvote for features. but i cannot remember the name of itUpd2. something like this: https://featureupvote.com/ 2, but it’s same idea with different UI
Upd3. I find it - https://canny.io/?ref=producthunt 1

I love the idea of having almost like a “code review” for articles by fellow writers who are approved. Maybe you can get karma like reddit or something for reviewing.

Any thought on using the ActivityPub 3 protocol?
I’m not an expert, but it would be great if content edited on HackerNoon 2.0 were part of a federation.
What do you think about Po.et thing?
Maybe it’s a goog shit?

Hi Arthur,
I came across your information on LinkedIn and GitHub and I'd love to connect. I am very impressed with your technical knowledge. I enjoyed reading your LinkedIn summary as well. How are things with GroceriStar? It looks like you've been working on this product for almost 2 years.
I work in recruiting at Toptal. We are an entirely remote company that connects the world's best talent with top companies. We have a large core engineering team (170+) and are looking for a FrontEnd Engineer to help us on our present and future challenges.
This FrontEnd Engineer role is for our Public Pages Team or, as we call it, the PUB team. This team is responsible for the look and feel of toptal.com. We work closely with a caring product manager, an attentive project manager, a great team of designers, and our invaluable siblings, CMS and SEO teams. Product-wise, our main focus is growth and enjoyable user experience, and tech-wise, we care about code quality and the developer experience. Our two interconnected undertakings for the near future is to rebuild the website, alongside migrating front-end code from a legacy Rails monolith to a slim and modern React-based renderer service that we develop ourselves.
They're looking for self-sufficient developers who are experienced with the modern front-end technologies, approaches, and tools. Like any other position at Toptal, we offer flexible working hours, location independence, and good salaries.

Hello again, Arthur. I am following up on my last email. I am very interested in learning more about the types of challenges you like to work on. We could use your help with any of these challenges:
Improving communication across teams;
Tackling technical debt while still launching new features;
Slaying monoliths;
Creating career paths and mentoring the next generation of technical leaders;
Developing an OSS program;
Finding better paths to connect top talent and companies around the world.
I believe we are shaping the future of work and I think you can help.

Hi Arthur,
I am glad that you want to know more. The role is for our core team and this means it is not a freelancer role, with projects for our clients, but it is focused on building and scaling up our great platform and in addition all of the tools and applications we have on top of that.
